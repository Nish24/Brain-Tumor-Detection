# Brain-Tumor-Detection

DATASET:  https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohammadhossein77/brain-tumors-dataset

This project aims to develop a website for brain image analysis, focusing on the detection of tumors. The process begins with acquiring brain image data from a reliable source, followed by visualization and preprocessing to optimize the dataset. The data is then partitioned into training, validation, and test sets for model development. Multiple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures are trained and evaluated to select the most effective model. Upon choosing the best model, it is tested and saved for future use. The web interface is designed to allow users to upload brain images and receive predictions regarding the presence of tumors, with specific information provided if a tumor is detected. The project concludes with the deployment of the website and discussion of potential future enhancements.
